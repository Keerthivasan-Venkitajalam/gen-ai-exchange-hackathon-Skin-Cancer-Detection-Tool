## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer encountered in individuals. It usually occurs in the skin region that is mostly exposed to the outside world.
Moles are common and the chances of a mole turning into a skin cancer is very rare but never zero. This is a scenario when this Web based application would come in handy. If a user is suspicious about a mole, he/she can upload an image of the mole and see if it falls under the category of cancerous.
This model is in it's initial phase right now and would only get better as new and improved images are used to train the model.
One thing to note is that no software is 100% accurate so if you are suspicious about your mole you should see a Doctor.
